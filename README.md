# AquaQ Challenge Solutions User Interface

> This is not in any way associated with the company AquaQ. These are only my
> solutions to their challenge hosted on `challenges.aquaq.co.uk`.

This is a React user interface bootstrapped with create react app of my solutions
for the AquaQ challenges hosted on their website. You can follow the instructions
below to launch the app.

I only have solutions so far for challenges 0, 1, and 5. I've written this in such
a way to make adding the solutions to more challenges easy enough.

All challenges were originally solved using the Deno runtime, then ported over to
the web to run inside this website.

I'll add a bit more interactivity to each solution where it's appropriate later.
Examples of this might include an interactive T9 user interface, allowing the
user to supply their own input, etc.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
